//A string can be any text inside double or single quotes. 
//It may contain letters, words, spaces, numbers, symbols, or almost anything you like
//It does not have to end with a semicolon
//but this is good practice
//varvariablename='stringtext';

var myCar='Infinti';
var myComputer='HP, 500 MHz, 128MB';
var jibberish='I am @ home 4 now. yeah! lol, right!'

var firstName = 'Danyel';

//This will return: Danyel. 
console.log(firstName);

//Adding more than one string together is called a concatenation

var firstName = 'Danyel';
var lastName = 'Davis';

//This will return Danyel Davis and adding the '' allows for a space in between the text
console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName);


//if you have an apostrophe in your string, the code will break, so do the following instead

var n = 'Danyel\'s dog is the cutest';
console.log(n);
