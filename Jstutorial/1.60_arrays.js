//is basically just a list of items

var students = new Array();

students[0] = 'Dee';
students[1] = 'Billy';
students[2] = 'Sam';
students[3] = 'Larry';
students[4] = 'Sheila';

//It can also be written as 

var students = ['Dee', 'Billy', 'Sam', 'Larry', 'Sheila'];

//JS is 0 based, so that is why it starts with 0 and not 1
